Every tech person's gotta have one, right?

I've tried to build site/blog type projects before, and I wish I had thought of using a static site generator earlier. This is my second time using Eleventy as a static site generator and it's been a really simple and fun experience. Combined with Tailwind for the styling, I've managed to get away with no JavaScript on the site at all, which makes the build dead simple too.
