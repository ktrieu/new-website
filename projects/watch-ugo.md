So, one day, I got to thinking: how hard is it to make a WatchMojo video? Don't you just have to have some voice reading auto-generated text over some stock images? Combine this with the idea of having a top 10 video for _any_ topic, and slap some [UGO II](/projects/ugo-ii-website) branding on it, and you have WatchUGO.

Technically, this has two hard-ish problems: extracting items from the unstructured data that is Wikipedia list articles, and programatically rendering video. The answer to the first is "try your best (and it's funny if you fail, so it's OK)". The answer is the second is "use a library".

And it turns out, it's actually pretty hard to make a WatchMojo video. The WatchUGO ones are pretty boring.
