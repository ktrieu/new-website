One half weird performance comedy piece, one half inside joke, and one half Gatsby learning project. In terms of technical value, there isn't much here, though this _is_ where I discovered my love of Tailwind, and I think I did pretty well emulating a "sterile corporate brand identity".

But, this site's real purpose is a fun creative outlet for when I want to add some more to the legend of the world's most powerful/evil/insane company.
