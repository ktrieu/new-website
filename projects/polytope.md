Every now and then (usually between terms of school), I decide to mess around with OpenGL and C++ and see what I can get done. I usually get about as far as "draw imported models" before I get bored and stop, so for this one I told myself I had to do something new before I abandoned this project.

I ended up trying two things:

- A separate tool that automatically watches data files like textures and models and builds them into intermediate formats. This is a luxury from web dev that I really miss when working on graphics stuff.
- Shadow mapping, which looks really cool and is actually not that bad to implement, if you have a tutorial.

Mission accomplished.
