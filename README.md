** NEW Website **

NEW stands for Novel Electronic Web-- no, I'm just kidding, I just couldn't think of a good name.

This is the new version of my personal website, with 100% more blog support, and 100% less weird giant photos of myself.

Built on the [John Lazeez Memorial Scholarship](https://github.com/ktrieu/jlms) tech stack (Eleventy and Tailwind).
