> The average blog has one or two posts. - Albert Einstein

Yeah. So I started this iteration of my website roughly a half a year ago, and added the whole blog page and Markdown based site generation thing. The usual "software guy who thinks he can write" deal.

It's been a year and I really haven't written anything, with the exception of an intro to OS development in Rust. It's nice but it also took forever to write and I kind of don't want to write another one (I should.) 

When I wrote my [very first article](/writing/purpose/) on here, I said I wanted this to be some kind of creative outlet, and I wanted this to get me to work more on random projects. In hindsight, I focused too much on the second and got the causality reversed. Somehow that became "only write on here when you have built a project worth showing".

That seems like a recipe for never writing anything here at all.

So: smaller stuff, maybe sillier stuff. 

Oh, and also I've changed from an explicit "blog" framing to just "writing". Some guy on Twitter said it makes your lack of articles look more like deliberate curation instead of a lack of executive function, which makes sense to me.
