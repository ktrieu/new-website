It's tax season! If, like me, you went to the US and made some money last year, and if you want to contribute money to public goods while also remaining safe from criminal prosecution, read this guide. I'll go through the steps you need to file taxes, and show my work so you can do it too. Or just read it to procrastinate other stuff, I won't judge.

First, some disclaimers and explanatory notes. If you don't care about this and want to get right to the (taxable) money shot, [click here.](#the-game-plan)

## Disclaimers

We live in a modern, specialized economy, which means it is much easier to Pay a Guy to do things you don't know how to do. I am a psycho who derives joy from filling in forms and untangling bureaucracy, so I am doing them myself, but, **the only way to be sure your taxes are done right is to Pay a Guy to do them.**

Also, this guide is written from my perspective, i.e., a Canadian citizen from the University of Waterloo, who went to the US for only four months on a J-1 visa. **If this does not exactly fit your situation, this may not work for you.**

Finally, **I am not a lawyer or an accountant.** There may be mistakes in here. However, if there _are_ mistakes in here, you can be comforted by the fact that they'll probably be affecting me too.

## Notes

A lot of tax advice on the Internet is very "trust me on this one, dude". That is, they just tell you to do things without really pointing to a source that backs it up or explaining why. I don't like that, so wherever possible, I will be explaining _why_ you need to do something, with links back to the IRS/CRA websites. If these get too detailed, they'll be hidden away in sections:

<details>
    <summary>Like this.</summary>
    Hello there.
</details>

## The Game Plan

We are going to have to do three things:

- File our US tax returns, noting the amount of tax we paid.
- File our state tax returns (California for me), again noting the amount of tax we paid.
- File our Canadian tax returns, claiming the taxes we paid above as a foreign tax credit so we don't get double taxed.

We'll go through these one-by-one.

## US Federal Returns

Before we get started, we should cover what you are to America. For tax purposes, _if you are a Canadian citizen on a J-1 visa_, you are referred to by the delightfully sci-fi term **nonresident alien**.

::: details What makes me a nonresident alien?
According to the IRS page on [nonresident aliens](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-aliens):

> An alien is any individual who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. national. A nonresident alien is an alien who has not passed the green card test or the substantial presence test.

The [green card test](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-tax-residency-green-card-test) states that anyone with a green card (a permanent resident) is not a nonresident alien.

The [substantial presence test](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test) has some fairly complicated rules around how long you've been in the US for the last three years. Luckily for us:

> A student temporarily present in the U.S. under an "F," "J," "M," or "Q" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa

doesn't count under this rule. If the only time you've spent in the US was under a J-1 visa for co-op, the substantial presence test does not apply to you.
:::

Nonresident aliens get a special version of the standard 1040 form, [the 1040NR](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1040-nr). You can fill out [a PDF version](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040nr.pdf), as well as view the frankly monstrous [instructions.](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040nr) If you're planning on reading those instructions yourself, you will also need the instructions for the OG [Form 1040.](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi) The 1040NR instructions are merely an add-on to those.

::: details Why this form?
The [instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040nr#en_US_2022_publink100057473) say:

> You must file Form 1040-NR if any of the following conditions apply to you.
>
> 1.  You were a nonresident alien engaged in a trade or business in the United States during 2022.

Being "engaged in a trade or business" is a surprisingly tricky concept to define, but according to the IRS's explainer on [Effectively Connected Income](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/effectively-connected-income-eci#:~:text=You%20are%20considered%20to%20be%20engaged%20in%20a%20trade%20or%20business%20in%20the%20United%20States%20if%20you%20are%20temporarily%20present%20in%20the%20United%20States%20as%20a%20nonimmigrant%20on%20an%20%22F%2C%22%20%22J%2C%22%20%22M%2C%22%20or%20%22Q%22%20visa):

> You are considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States if you are temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant on an "F," "J," "M," or "Q" visa.

That's you.

We'll go through each box on the form step-by-step.

### For the year Jan. 1 - Dec 31. 2022

Ignore this line. This is for [fiscal year filers](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#en_US_2022_publink1000107557) to specify that their tax year is different from a calendar year. You almost certainly don't want to do this.

### Filing Status

You probably already have an answer to this one. If you're not married, check "Single". You'd probably know if you were an estate or a trust, so leave those unchecked.

### Name/Address

This is your current address. I was originally confused about whether this referred to the address you lived at in the United States, but the fact that they have boxes for "foreign country name" and others indicate that they probably want your current address in Canada.

### Your identifying number

[The instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040nr#en_US_2022_publink100061734) give you three options here, including an SSN. If you worked for a company on a J-1 visa, you almost certainly have one, and should use it.

### Digital Assets

They're looking to see if you did anything with crypto. If you did anything other than hold crypto or buy it with US dollars, you have to check "yes". Unfortunately I received one (1) free NFT as part of a promotion from FTX (which counts!), so I had to check yes.

If you sold, which I never did, you also have to report this as capital gains on some secondary forms [the 1040 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#en_US_2022_publink1000111717) will tell you about. Have fun with that.

::: details Do I have to check yes?
This is all from the [Form 1040 instructions.](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#en_US_2022_publink1000111717)

Digital assets are:

> any digital representations of value that are recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology. For example, digital assets include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins.

I'm not a crypto expert but this seems to include everything you might think of as "crypto", including Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs, and various shitcoins.

They want you to check "yes" if you received digital assets as payment, for mining, or as a gift, or if you sold them. Selling, by the way, is a pretty broad definition, including selling for money, for things of value like property, and for other digital assets.

If all your crypto activity is covered by these three exceptions, then you can check "no":

> - Holding a digital asset in a wallet or account
> - Transferring a digital asset from one wallet or account you own or control to another wallet or account that you own or control
> - Purchasing digital assets using U.S. or other real currency, including through the use of electronic platforms such as PayPal and Venmo.

For some reason, getting a gift isn't an exception but buying them is, which means I have to check yes thanks to a free gift from a company that doesn't even exist anymore.

### Dependents

There's a huge amount of rules to determine who is and is not a dependent. If you want to read them, they're [here.](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#en_US_2022_publink10004904)

In broad strokes, unless you have a younger relative (or an older, poor one) that lived with you in the US, and that you financially supported, you shouldn't put down anything here.

### Lines 1a through 1z

This is real Tax Hours now. Box 1a should be the number in box 1 on your W-2 (the American equivalent of the T4). Check your HR platform/email if you don't have one. The instructions warn you that this should be income _effectively connected with a US trade or business_. Any salary from an American business counts, but see below for a more detailed explanation.

You can ignore the rest of the boxes unless you made less than US$10,000 for the entire year. In that case, check line 1k in the section below.

::: details I want to know more about Line 1
First, let's figure out what exactly income _effectively connected with a US trade or business_ is. [Publication 519](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p519#en_US_2022_publink1000222326) seems to be the main source on this, and it says

> Personal service income you receive in a tax year in which you are engaged in a U.S. trade or business is effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business... Personal service income includes wages, salaries...

So yeah, looks like wages from US businesses are certainly covered. We are kind of overthinking this, I will admit, but it's good (and fun!) to make sure of these things.

The [1040 instructions](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040gi#en_US_2022_publink24811vd0e4597) run through most of the boxes I said to ignore. Let's go through them:

_Line 1b (Household Employee Wages Not Reported on Form(s) W-2)_

If you're a household employee ([housekeepers, maids, babysitters, gardeners, and others](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc756)), your employer can pay you up to $2,400 without giving you a W-2. This probably doesn't apply to you.

_Line 1c (Tip Income Not Reported on Line 1a)_

This is for tips you didn't report to your employer (since that doesn't make it onto a W-2). This probably doesn't apply to you.

_Line 1d (Medicaid Waiver Payments Not Reported on Form(s) W-2)_

A [Medicaid Waiver](https://www.investopedia.com/medicaid-waiver-5217848) is a special legal mechanism that allows the federal or state government to change the rules - you're probably not eligible for Medicaid.

_Line 1e (Taxable Dependent Care Benefits From Form 2441, Line 26)_

These are [benefits from your employer](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dependent-care-benefits.asp) to help you care for dependents. As discussed above, you probably don't have any.

_Line 1f (Employer-Provided Adoption Benefits From Form 8839, Line 29)_

Your employer probably didn't help you adopt anyone.

_Line 1g (Wages From Form 8919, Line 6)_

[Form 8919](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-8919) deals with uncollected Social Security and Medicare taxes in the case where you were an employee but your employer treated you as an independent contractor. J-1 visa holders are actually [exempt](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/aliens-employed-in-the-us-social-security-taxes#:~:text=Nonresident%20alien%20students%2C%20scholars%2C%20professors,States%20as%20long%20as%20such) from these taxes.

_Line 1h (Other Earned Income)_

This is a catch-all "other" box. The one thing here that might be relevant is if you received a scholarship in the US that didn't give you a W-2, in which case you'd have to report it on a separate form, Schedule 1. This doesn't apply to me, so I won't go into it.

_Line 1k (Treaty-Exempt Income)_

This is a special [1040NR box](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i1040nr#en_US_2022_publink100047363) for all "income that is exempt from tax by an income tax treaty". Canada and the US actually have a [tax treaty](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/tax-policy/tax-treaties/country/united-states-america-convention-consolidated-1980-1983-1984-1995-1997.html), but to the best of my knowledge, there are almost no exemptions that would apply to your average co-op student.

The one exception is [this passage](<https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/tax-policy/tax-treaties/country/united-states-america-convention-consolidated-1980-1983-1984-1995-1997.html#:~:text=such%20remuneration%20does%20not%20exceed%20ten%20thousand%20dollars%20(%2410%2C000)%20in%20the%20currency%20of%20that%20other%20State>) that states that income under US$10,000 can be taxed in Canada only. However, most co-ops would pay more than that, I imagine.

If you do fall under this, you need to complete a separate schedule OI form and to enter Line 1a as 0. Again, this doesn't apply to me, so I won't go into more detail. Read the instructions for more info.
