It's tax season! If, like me, you went to the US and made some money last year, and if you want to contribute money to public goods while also remaining safe from criminal prosecution, read this guide. I'll go through the steps you need to file taxes, and show my work so you can do it too. Or just read it to procrastinate other stuff, I won't judge.

First, some disclaimers and explanatory notes. If you don't care about this and want to get right to the (taxable) money shot, [click here.](#the-game-plan)

## Disclaimers

We live in a modern, specialized economy, which means it is much easier to Pay a Guy to do things you don't know how to do. I am a psycho who derives joy from filling in forms and untangling bureaucracy, so I am doing them myself, but, **the only way to be sure your taxes are done right is to Pay a Guy to do them.**

Also, this guide is written from my perspective, i.e., a Canadian citizen from the University of Waterloo, who went to the US for only four months on a J-1 visa. **If this does not exactly fit your situation, this may not work for you.**

Finally, **I am not a lawyer or an accountant.** There may be mistakes in here. However, if there _are_ mistakes in here, you can be comforted by the fact that they'll probably be affecting me too.

## Notes

A lot of tax advice on the Internet is very "trust me on this one, dude". That is, they just tell you to do things without really pointing to a source that backs it up or explaining why. I don't like that, so wherever possible, I will be explaining _why_ you need to do something, with links back to the IRS/CRA websites. For flow, these will be hidden away in sections:

## The Game Plan

We are going to have to do three things:

- File our US tax returns, noting the amount of tax we paid.
- File our state tax returns (California for me), again noting the amount of tax we paid.
- File our Canadian tax returns, claiming the taxes we paid above as a foreign tax credit so we don't get double taxed.

We'll go through these one-by-one.

## US Federal Returns

Before we get started, we should cover what you are to America. For tax purposes, _if you are a Canadian citizen on a J-1 visa_, you are referred to by the delightfully sci-fi term **nonresident alien**.

    <summary>What makes me a nonresident alien?</summary>

    According to the IRS page on [nonresident aliens](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/nonresident-aliens):

    <blockquote>
    An alien is any individual who is not a U.S. citizen or U.S. national. A nonresident alien is an alien who has not passed the green card test or the substantial presence test.
    </blockquote>

    The [green card test](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/us-tax-residency-green-card-test) states that anyone with a green card (a permanent resident) is not a nonresident alien.

    The [substantial presence test](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/substantial-presence-test) has some fairly complicated rules around how long you've been in the US for the last three years. Luckily for us:

    <blockquote>
    A student temporarily present in the U.S. under an "F," "J," "M," or "Q" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa
    </blockquote>

    doesn't count under this rule. If the only time you've spent in the US was under a J-1 visa for co-op, the substantial presence test does not apply to you.

    Most UWaterloo students will fail both these tests.
